/// `AppContext` is the object graph for the app. It's designed with dependency injection in mind, but doesn't use a dedicated DI framework.
///
/// Consider this AppContext just one way to do DI, another approach is simply passing smaller objects into the initializers of larger objects, forcing a heirarchical, directed ownership graph which is owned by the `AppDelegate` instead of an `AppContext` which "owns" *everything* in a flattened structure.
///
/// My personal goals for DI were:
/// o Does not rely on runtime or force-casting
/// o Does not rely on metaprogramming or configuration files
/// o Simple to understand
///
/// The `AppContext` approach checks the above boxes, but its downsides are:
/// o It's a class that can grow very large if not broken up.
/// o It doesn't mandate a directed graph, so it's possible to create circular dependencies (break these with closures).
/// o There is not a strict inversion of control, as is common in many DI constructions.
///
/// There are many approaches to dependency injection, and plenty more to say on the subject, but for the sake of brevity, let's move on...
